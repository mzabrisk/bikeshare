## Overview
Our company is considering open a bike rental service in Des Moines, IA, similar to citibike in New York City. We are condunting an analysis of bike trips in New York during the month of August 2019 to help determine whether or not the service has potential for Des Moines.


## Results
We started our analysis looking at average trip duration. We saw that the vast majority of users use the bikes for <20 minutes at a time.

Looking at a heatmap showing peak use by day and hour, it appears that for Monday-Friday, use peaks during the commuting hours. Use is more consistent throughout the day (at least during daylight hours) on the weekends.

Looking at the same heatmap, but broken out by gender, it shows that use pattern is similar between males and females. Comparatively, Unknown users use the service more on the weekends and in the evenings.

Lookng at another heatmap showing use by gender by day of the week, the main take away is that essentially all users with unknown gender are non-subscribers.

In an attempt to campare the top starting and ending points the maps from the module, with point size and color indicating level of use, were placed side by side. Doing so does a fairly effective job, but the graphic takes a lot of back and forth to compare and you can never be certain the exact same stations are being compared.

To make it easier to compare the same start and end locations, heatmaps sorted by the most used stations were generated:
